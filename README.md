# Autonomous Delivery Agent

An AI-powered delivery agent that navigates a 2D grid city using various search algorithms.

## Features

- **Multiple Search Algorithms**: BFS, Uniform-Cost Search, A* with different heuristics
- **Dynamic Environment**: Moving obstacles and changing terrain costs
- **Replanning Capability**: Hill climbing and simulated annealing for dynamic obstacles
- **Visualization**: Animated delivery routes and performance metrics
